// Config supplies browsing settings, storage, and release information to [Run]. The caller

	// Connector supplies authentication and safe setup instructions for the selected backend.
	Connector connection.Connector

	// Connections returns an immutable menu snapshot owned by application assembly.
	// Run reads it at startup and after authentication. It must be safe to call
	// while a connector runs and must perform no I/O. Nil hides the action.
	// ConnectionID identifies the current route.
	Connections  func() []connection.Choice
	ConnectionID string
	// ReturnConnectionID is the last connected route, used when setup is canceled.
	// Empty means canceling setup exits instead of restoring another browser.
	ReturnConnectionID string
	// Navigation optionally retains this connection's location between Run calls.
	// The caller must give each connection its own value and serialize access.
	Navigation *Navigation

	// MusicVisuals contains validated immutable presets. Nil disables visuals.
	// Startup assembly supplies defaults. Selected images load on a worker.
	MusicVisuals *musicviz.Library

	// Title replaces the heading on the carousel and root library list.
	// Nil uses MiSTerVision. An empty value hides the heading. The renderer
	// truncates it before the clock. The caller must not modify the value during Run.
	Title *string

	// ShowCollections and ShowPlaylists control their home cards. Nil shows a
	// category when nonempty. False hides it even when populated. Callers must
	// not modify these values during Run.

	// Diagnostics is borrowed until Run and its tracked cleanup finish. Nil disables logging.

	// Build identifies the executable in About and in server client requests.

	// cancellation. Nil disables network checks. The browser serializes calls.

	// Updater installs a release outside the event loop. Nil permits release
	// notes but requires manual installation. Run cancels and joins active work.

	RestartAfterUpdate bool

	// StateDir holds private authentication and playback state.

	// The browser adds a subdirectory for each server and user after sign-in.
	ArtworkCacheDir string
	// MosaicCacheDir holds library background collages. Empty disables mosaic
	// disk caching. The browser adds the same server and user isolation as artwork.
