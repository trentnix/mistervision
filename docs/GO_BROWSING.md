# Browsing and sign-in

Use the [MiSTer launcher](GO_BUILD.md#install-on-mister) or [development harness](../tools/ghostty/README.md). The home carousel shows server library names and a combined Continue Watching card. Tab/SELECT switches between the carousel and root library list.

Interface text uses the same Noto fonts as captions. List titles are bold, and About, connection choices, and account prompts use larger white body text. Navigation hints and the clock retain the bitmap font. Home and library lists share title and subtext sizes and roomy row spacing. The home List view shows one fewer row to leave room for the update notice and viewer information. Subtext is indented. Two-line selections have equal visible padding above the title and below the subtext. The home carousel and root List view share the title, update notice, and active viewer in the same positions.

Each home-list row shows its library count as results arrive. Both home views share one count cache and up to three concurrent requests, prioritized for the selected library and visible rows. Selection changes and switching views do not cancel count requests. Successful counts stay fresh for one minute. Failed requests retain the previous count and wait one minute before another background attempt. Explicit Retry can refresh sooner.

Count requests do not fetch artwork. Music totals represent albums on Jellyfin and artists on Plex. Live TV totals count channels.

Library lists reserve a 215-pixel side column for artwork or guide information. Artwork is centered between the header and button hints, with its aspect ratio preserved. Plex channel names prefer guide titles such as ABC or Grit, then fall back to tuner names and call letters.

Season lists show episode counts when the server supplies them. A show with exactly one available season opens its episode list directly. Back returns to the show list. Shows with multiple seasons, including a separate Specials season, keep the season picker.

## Setup and sign-in

Connection settings normally come from `settings.json`. Invalid JSON connection settings stop startup with a field-level error. Restart after correcting them.

When no `server` section exists, the client reads legacy `jellyfin.conf` if present. A missing legacy file starts Jellyfin discovery. An invalid legacy file opens setup help instead of selecting a different server. Connection, disabled Quick Connect, unknown username, and sign-in storage failures have separate recovery instructions. Open/Enter retries after you correct the file. R is a retry alias. Back returns to discovery when sign-in followed a discovery selection. Otherwise, Back opens the connection chooser when connections are available, or exits setup. Start/F1 opens About during discovery, connection attempts, approval, and errors. Choosing another connection cancels the unfinished attempt. Canceling from the connection chooser restores About on the last connected browser, or exits if none exists.

Jellyfin Quick Connect displays a public approval code. Enter it in an already signed-in Jellyfin client. The waiting indicator animates until approval or the five-minute timeout. New code cancels the previous attempt. The screen does not expose credentials or Quick Connect secrets.

Plex uses an account-link code at `plex.tv/link`. The linked account provides access to its servers. For Plex Home, the selected viewer determines the available libraries and playback history. Choose Plex under About → Connections to link an account and select a server without editing configuration. [Plex support](GO_PLEX.md) describes sign-in and provider-specific limits.

The standard MiSTer state directory is `/media/fat/mistervision/state`. Desktop defaults to `~/.config/mistervision`, or `mistervision` under `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when set. The executable's `-state-dir` or harness's `--state-dir` overrides that directory. Jellyfin stores the active sign-in in `session.json` and separately authorized users in `jellyfin-users.json`. Plex keeps its linking account, viewing profile, and server grant together in `plex/server.json`. [Discovered Plex connections](GO_PLEX.md#server-discovery) use `discovery/plex/server.json`. Older Plex sign-in files remain readable during migration.

Saved sessions are bound to the server URL. C `token.conf` and `device.conf` files are not imported.

Network and server failures retain valid saved credentials. Rejected credentials require authentication again. Damaged Jellyfin or legacy Plex session files are backed up before a fresh sign-in. Current Plex account-and-viewer records remain untouched and show a storage error so recovery cannot silently select another viewer. See [saved sign-in recovery](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#saved-sign-in-recovery). TLS verification is enabled unless [configured otherwise](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#server-connection).

## Jellyfin discovery

When no server is configured, the client first checks its remembered Jellyfin selection. If none exists, it scans directly connected IPv4 networks for three seconds using UDP port 7359. The picker shows server names and addresses, including when only one server answers. Up/Down selects a row, Open connects, Select/Tab or R scans again, and Back opens connection choices. Quick Connect follows selection. During connection, approval, or a sign-in failure after selection, Back cancels the attempt and scans again so you can choose another server. Back from the connection chooser restores the previous connected browser, or exits if none exists. Back is also available when a later launch reuses the remembered server but still needs sign-in.

After sign-in succeeds, the selection is stored in `jellyfin-server.json` under the state directory. Until then, the selected server stays in memory for new-code retries. Canceling setup keeps the previous server and sign-in. Later launches connect to the successfully authenticated server and reuse valid sign-in. Discovery does not create or edit configuration files. An explicit JSON server or an existing legacy configuration always takes precedence. Invalid explicit configuration never triggers discovery. An unreadable or damaged saved selection shows recovery instructions and is preserved.

If no servers appear, make sure Jellyfin discovery is enabled and UDP port 7359 can reach the server. Containers must expose that UDP port. Broadcast discovery normally stays on the local subnet. Retry after fixing the network, or set `server.url` in `settings.json` using the [connection example](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#server-connection). If connecting to a remembered address fails, MiSTerVision scans once for the same server ID and checks its public identity without sending credentials. A matching new address opens **Server address changed**. Select it to reconnect with your saved sign-in, or press Back to cancel. The new address is remembered after sign-in succeeds. Failed recovery preserves your sign-in and offers Retry. Explicitly configured addresses never change automatically, and HTTPS connections cannot recover to HTTP. Use About → Connections to choose a different server.

## Jellyfin users

For Quick Connect connections with multiple saved users, open About and press Up for **Switch profile**. With only the current user saved for that server, About offers **Add user** directly and skips the picker.

The picker shows users previously authorized on this device for the current server. Left/Right selects a user. Open switches to that user’s libraries and viewing history. Avatars load independently, and missing images use the name’s initial. More than three users scroll through the same three-card layout as Plex.

Select **Add user** with the displayed control (Select on the default controller, Tab on the keyboard). Approve the Quick Connect code in a Jellyfin client signed in as the intended user. No password or PIN is entered on the CRT. Back from the code returns to the picker, or directly to About if Add user started there. Back from the picker restores About with the previous user still active. A successful switch opens the selected user’s browser.

Later launches reopen the last selected user automatically.

Each saved user has a separate token and device identity. Only the active user receives remote commands. Artwork, playback preferences, and viewing history stay scoped to the user. Selecting an expired sign-in requires Quick Connect again and identifies the user who needs approval. If approval returns a different user, a confirmation is required before switching. Temporary failures retain saved credentials. Names and avatar references refresh after successful authentication.

To remove the current user's saved sign-in, open About and use the displayed **Forget** control. In the user picker, Down offers **Forget user** for the selected person. Both require confirmation. Forgetting the active user returns to the remaining saved users, or Quick Connect if none remain. Cancel leaves the sign-in available and preserves the highlighted user in the picker. Removal applies only to this connection on this device and does not delete the Jellyfin account or media.

Anyone using this device can select its saved users without another password prompt. To revoke access, remove the corresponding device session in Jellyfin.

API-key connections keep their configured username and do not offer user switching. Named server connections in `connections.profiles` are separate from these saved users. Neither adding nor switching users changes `settings.json`. See [saved sign-in recovery](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#saved-sign-in-recovery).

## Navigation

| Action | Controller | Keyboard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select a row | Up/Down | Up/Down |
| Change home card or jump a list screen | Left/Right | Left/Right or Page Up/Page Down |
| Open | B | Enter, B, or X |
| Back | A | Escape, Backspace, A, or Z |
| Switch home view | Select | Tab |
| About | Start | F1 |
| Retry | Configured retry binding | R |
| Quit | Configured quit binding | Q or Ctrl+C |

On-screen badges follow the active [input profile](GO_INPUT.md). Back at home opens exit confirmation.

Held directions accelerate. Lists keep selection near the center except at the first and last rows. Neighboring pages load ahead, and arrivals preserve the selected position. A late page leaves existing rows visible with a loading message. Back restores the parent selection.

For Jellyfin, movies and music videos use filtered recursive lists. Music retains artist → album → track navigation. Mixed and home-video libraries retain folders. Series and seasons use Jellyfin's Shows endpoints. Live TV preserves server channel order and opens a channel directly into playback. Stopping returns to that channel in the list.

Details show available artwork, overview, year, rating, runtime, and resume/watched state. Open starts or resumes video. SELECT/Tab restarts an unwatched resumable video from the beginning. See [playback controls](GO_PLAYBACK.md#playback-controls).

Interface text and subtitles share a broad Unicode font set. Navigation hints and the clock retain the bitmap font and its more limited fallback. See [text coverage](GO_RENDERING.md#text-coverage). Search is not implemented.

## Live TV listings

Channel lists show the current program beneath each channel when guide data is available. The selected channel's side panel shows its logo when available, followed by the current and next programs with time ranges in the device's local time zone. The panel stays blank when no listings are available. Selecting a channel starts playback immediately. Back returns to the channel list.

Schedules load separately from channels through the optional `media.ProgramGuide` interface. Jellyfin and Plex adapters translate their own channel identifiers and schedule data. The browser requests a six-hour window for the loaded channel page, refreshes once a minute, and cancels work after leaving the list. The most recent channel page stays cached in memory for the active connection and user. Page changes retain listings for channels still loaded. Returning shows valid cached listings immediately and always requests a fresh schedule, even within the one-minute interval. Successful responses replace the cache, including corrected or removed listings. A failed refresh keeps cached listings, but expired programs are never shown as current. Authentication changes discard the cache. Current/next selection advances with the clock without waiting for a refresh.

A server must have guide listings configured. Missing or failed listings leave channels playable. Failures record a `browser.guide` diagnostic event without a blocking error banner. Full schedule grids, favorite-channel editing, DVR scheduling, and timeshifting are not implemented.

## Continue Watching

The first card, labeled Continue, combines resumable videos and the next unwatched episode of series in progress. For Jellyfin, each series appears once. Its most recently played resumable episode takes precedence over Next Up. Recent playback orders dated entries first. Undated series retain Jellyfin's Next Up order.

For Plex, the card uses the first 100 entries of the server's combined feed from `/hubs/continueWatching/items`, keeping movies and episodes.

The card reserves its position while loading, so startup does not switch away from a briefly selected library. Empty results remove it while preserving library selection. A slow feed does not block other libraries.

Opening the card, returning home, and finishing recorded playback refresh the feed. Refreshes preserve the selected item or series. Partial failures keep usable results. R retries.

The Jellyfin adapter merges `/UserItems/Resume` and `/Shows/NextUp`, with a bounded recent-episode query for ordering. It reads pages before deduplication. Each source has an approximately 10,000-entry safety limit. Continue covers use the ordinary artwork cache. The changing combined collage is not stored as a library collage.

## Collections and playlists

Collections and Playlists appear in the carousel only when nonempty and enabled by [`ui.show_collections` and `ui.show_playlists`](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#carousel-categories). Both settings default to `true`. Jellyfin's existing card names are preserved. Collections retain their hierarchy, so a collection can contain movies, shows, albums, or other folders. Open a playlist to browse its entries in server order. Repeated entries remain separate rows.

Select a music track or video to start playback. Playback advances through the remaining audio/video entries, fetching pages as needed. The first selected video uses its normal resume position. Subsequent entries start at the beginning. Stopping or reaching the end returns to the list with the current entry selected. Music retains previous/next controls. Videos retain their existing pause and seek controls.

Photo playlists use the manual photo viewer. Automatic slideshows and playlist editing are not implemented.

Locally started playlists publish the current item to Jellyfin remote controls and support previous/next commands. Sending a playlist from another Jellyfin client uses the existing bounded remote queue.

Books, comics, and audiobook categories are hidden from the carousel. Display names do not determine library type. Plex has no dedicated audiobook category, so audiobooks stored as an ordinary music library remain indistinguishable from music.

## Photos

Photos open full screen with preserved proportions. Left/Right moves through photos, including across pages. Up toggles controls, which expire after three seconds. Back restores the folder with the current photo selected. R retries a failed image. Slideshows and photo zoom are not implemented.

## About and updates

Start or F1 opens and closes About while browsing. Back also closes it. About is unavailable during media playback and loading a media item. It remains available during setup. Press Down for Connections, then choose an existing connection, Jellyfin discovery, or Plex setup. See [multiple connections](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#multiple-connections).

For Jellyfin Quick Connect users and Plex Home, Up opens **Switch profile** when another viewer is available. With only one saved Jellyfin user, Up opens **Add user**. Plex omits the action when only one profile exists. Back from the picker returns to About. The active viewer’s avatar and name appear on About, the home carousel, and the root List view. See [profile and PIN behavior](GO_PLEX.md#plex-home-profiles). About also shows the logo, installed version, Trent Nix’s credit, the original MiSTerFin credit to Pudding Studio, and the [license](../LICENSE).

The client checks this repository's latest public stable release once per launch. Select/Tab or R checks again after the preceding request finishes. “Checking for updates...” stays visible for at least one second. Navigation hints remain visible during the check, and the logo and identity block stay in place. Stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions are compared numerically. Development builds can offer a public release without claiming it is newer than the checkout. Builds use the version described in the [build guide](GO_BUILD.md#go-client).

No GitHub credentials are sent. A missing or inaccessible release displays “No public release available.” Network, rate-limit, and invalid-response failures display “Could not check for updates.” Neither means the installation is current. If an update is offered, Open shows its release notes. Up/Down scrolls the notes. Open again starts installation on a standard MiSTer installation. Desktop and custom installations show a manual-installation message.

Release authors can put concise on-screen text under `## Release summary` in the GitHub release description. Use plain paragraphs and optional third-level headings. The app displays that section through the next first- or second-level heading. Put manual-installation instructions under a separate `## Installation` heading. Missing or empty summaries fall back to the full notes. Selected text is limited to 8,192 characters.

The updater downloads and verifies the release, backs up the installed files, then replaces the client and matching player. Back cancels during download or validation. During replacement, wait for completion. Success shows “Update installed. Restarting...” for two seconds before the app restarts. Custom launchers without restart support show a manual-relaunch message instead.

Failures restore the previous files. Startup recovers an interrupted replacement before opening the display. Settings, sign-in, playback choices, caches, and the optional 480i core stay intact. See [installation and recovery](GO_BUILD.md#application-updates).

## Persistent artwork cache

Covers, backdrops, and logos persist under `mistervision/covercache` within the cache root, partitioned by provider, server, and user. The first visit downloads images. Later visits and launches reuse decoded pixels. Image tags invalidate changed artwork. Metadata still requires the media server, so caching does not provide offline browsing. Full-screen photos use memory caching only.

| Cache | Per-account limit |
| --- | --- |
| Decoded image memory | 128 images / 16 MiB |
| Ordinary artwork disk cache | 512 images / 128 MiB |
| Library collage disk cache | 32 collages / 64 MiB |

Disk files have version, size, and checksum checks and are replaced atomically. Oldest-written entries are pruned first. Reads do not rewrite timestamps. Corrupt entries become misses.

Unavailable storage leaves browsing usable without disk caching. R invalidates the selected artwork for replacement. Disk work stays on workers, outside rendering.

## Persistent collage cache

Library mosaics persist under `mistervision/gridcache` in the same cache root. A worker restores saved pixels before refreshing sample IDs and image tags. Only changed images download again. Counts refresh independently. Incomplete loads do not replace a usable collage, and unchanged collages do not rewrite the SD card.

Default cache roots are `/media/fat` on MiSTer, the user's cache directory for direct desktop runs, and `/tmp/mistervision-cache` in the Ghostty harness. Set `MISTERVISION_CACHE_ROOT` to change the parent directory. Go appends `mistervision/covercache` or `mistervision/gridcache` and the account partition.

For a persistent desktop cache:

```sh
MISTERVISION_CACHE_ROOT="$HOME/.cache" python3 tools/ghostty/ghostty_harness.py --browse --ntsc --inline-video --settings settings.json
```

On MiSTer, export the variable in the launcher before starting the client. A new root populates a new cache and leaves old files intact. Custom [browsing backgrounds and titles](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#browsing-background) are separate settings.

## Errors and recovery

Library failures show a short explanation and the configured Retry control. Network failures, timeouts, missing items, rejected sign-in, and server errors have different recovery guidance. An unsuccessful request does not imply an empty library. Optional missing cover art stays out of the UI.

Long explanations wrap within CRT margins. About uses a compact identity block and shorter control descriptions when space is limited. Playback and update messages use the same layout rules on MiSTer and desktop output. Provider error text, request URLs, and credentials are not displayed. Diagnostics retain failure categories and request status codes.

User-facing error text uses named constants in each owning package’s `messages.go`: [browser](../internal/browser/messages.go), [rendering](../internal/rendering/messages.go), [startup](../cmd/mistervision/messages.go), [Jellyfin](../internal/jellyfin/connection/messages.go), and [Plex](../internal/plex/messages.go). [Shared connection messages](../internal/connection/messages.go) keep common sign-in and recovery wording consistent. Classification and recovery behavior stay at the call sites.
