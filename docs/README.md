## Current limits

Search, automatic photo slideshows, and photo zoom are not implemented. Server addresses can be set in configuration, but there is no on-screen address editor.

Plex relay connections, remote control, multi-file movies, and Plex’s free online TV are not implemented. Home profile management stays in Plex. MiSTerVision selects existing viewers and respects their access. See [Plex support and limits](GO_PLEX.md).

Jellyfin Live TV audio-track selection is unavailable. Plex exposes alternate live audio when the stream provides it. Live TV has no seeking or timeshift support.

The separate-window FFplay fallback has fewer controls than MiSTer and inline Ghostty. See [Plex limits](GO_PLEX.md#playback-and-limits) and the [playback guide](GO_PLAYBACK.md).

PAL 288p/576i, direct MiSTer YPbPr output, and optional MiSTer background-music restoration need testing by someone with suitable hardware. Zaparoo DDR integration is not implemented. See [tested display scope](GO_DISPLAY.md#tested-scope) and [menu music](GO_PLAYBACK.md#mister-menu-music). An in-app screenshot command and exact reproduction of C music visualizers are outside the current scope.

The original port plan and C hardware notes are preserved in Git history. They are not installation instructions for this client. The C reference is the [MiSTerFin integration repository](https://github.com/trentnix/MiSTerFin), branch `local-all-features`, starting at `19d99fa5f479692e45ea7b5dddc42e42fb1782a9`.
