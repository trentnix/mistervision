# Plex support

MiSTerVision’s Plex adapter supports account linking, movie, TV, music, and photo libraries, seasons and episodes, Continue Watching, artwork, playback, and tuner-backed Live TV. It shares the browser, controls, picture modes, and output implementations with Jellyfin. Jellyfin is the default provider.

## Server discovery

Open **About → Connections → Plex**. Enter the displayed code at [plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link) in a browser signed in to your Plex account. If the account belongs to a Plex Home, choose a viewing profile first. The server picker shows the active viewer and reachable servers. Select a server to connect. No server address is required in configuration.

Discovery combines the servers listed by your account with a short GDM scan of the local IPv4 network. LAN replies only add addresses for servers available to the linked account. Direct local connections take priority, with HTTPS preferred within local and remote groups. Each group probes its addresses concurrently for up to two seconds, so unreachable container interfaces do not prevent fallback to another group.

Each candidate must report the expected server identity before receiving its server token. Discovery respects servers that require HTTPS and verifies TLS certificates. Relay connections are excluded. GDM uses the responding device’s address, so a reachable LAN reply can replace an unreachable container address advertised by the account. GDM currently adds HTTP addresses only. Servers that require HTTPS continue to use verified HTTPS addresses from the account.

For LAN discovery, enable **Settings → Server → Network → Enable local network discovery (GDM)** in Plex and allow UDP port `32414` on the server network. Containers must expose discovery traffic to the LAN. If GDM is unavailable or receives no replies, discovery still checks the account’s advertised addresses. An explicit server address also works. See [Plex network settings](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430283-network/).

The successful choice reconnects automatically on later launches. About → Connections → Use existing connection returns to it while another provider is active. Selecting Plex again opens a fresh picker. Back cancels selection and lets you return to the previous connection. Failed or canceled selection preserves the working server.

Reopening a saved account without Plex Home checks the media server directly. Plex Home connections refresh profile access through plex.tv before opening media. If that address fails, MiSTerVision refreshes account and LAN discovery once and offers a verified new address for the same server. When **Server address changed** appears, select the server to confirm or press Back to leave setup. Recovery preserves HTTPS when the saved address used HTTPS and respects servers that require it. Explicitly configured URLs stay fixed unless you edit `server.url`. After an edit, the client checks the new endpoint’s identity and obtains a matching server grant from the linked account. It does not send the previous endpoint’s token to the new address.

Account linking, refreshing the server list, and address recovery require internet access. Temporary server or account-service outages preserve sign-in and show Retry. Canceling recovery, rejecting a candidate, or failing to save its address preserves the previous connection. Missing or rejected server credentials return to account validation and selection. Use About → Connections → Plex to choose a different server.

On **Choose a Plex server**, select **Sign in with another account** to get a new code. Open plex.tv/link with the account you want to use. Back cancels linking and returns to the saved account’s server picker. The replacement account is saved only after its selected server connects successfully. Scan again refreshes the server list without discarding the pending sign-in. Accounts with no reachable servers can still choose another sign-in.

To remove the linked account and its saved access tokens from this connection, open About and use **Sign out**. Confirmation is required. Settings, public server information, and Plex Home membership stay intact. Connecting again requires account linking. If an expired sign-in needs renewal, the code screen identifies the account. Approval from a different account requires confirmation unless you explicitly chose **Sign in with another account**.

Discovery saves the account credentials, selected server, and server credentials together in the private `state/discovery/plex/server.json` file. Older separate account and server credential files remain readable. Tokens never appear in the picker, logs, or configuration. Configured connections keep their own state directories and fixed server addresses.

## Plex Home profiles

After linking a Plex Home account, **Who’s watching?** shows profile names and avatars. Left/right selects a profile. The selected profile appears larger. Profiles appear immediately after Plex returns the member list. Avatars load in the background. A missing or unsupported avatar shows the profile’s initial.

When only one profile is available, startup skips the picker and About omits Switch profile. A protected profile still requires its PIN.

With more than three profiles, Left and Right scroll through three visible cards. A position counter shows the selected profile and total. Navigation stops at either end.

Protected profiles show the selected person’s avatar and name above “Please enter your PIN:” and a four-digit keypad. Use directions and Select to enter digits. Directions stop at the edges of each row and column. The fourth digit submits the PIN. **Delete** removes a digit.

Verification keeps the keypad visible with “Checking PIN…” and an activity indicator. Further digit entry is disabled until Plex responds. Back cancels verification and reopens profile selection. Before submitting a PIN, Back returns directly to the profiles.

An incorrect PIN shows “Incorrect PIN. Try again.” until you select the first digit of a new attempt or go Back. Moving around the keypad or choosing Delete leaves the message visible. PINs are masked, sent in the request body, and never saved or logged.

The last successful profile is remembered. Unprotected profiles reconnect automatically. Protected profiles require a PIN again after restarting the application. Plex Home startup requires internet access to check current permissions. An unavailable account service does not fall back to the linking account’s access.

If the remembered profile has been removed, the picker explains the change and requires a selection, even when only one profile remains. If Plex Home is no longer available, returning to the linking account requires confirmation. Profile names and avatar references refresh when Plex Home access is checked.

Open About and use **Switch profile** to change viewers. Back cancels the switch and returns to About on the current connection. The home carousel, root List view, and About show the active profile’s avatar beside its name. A missing avatar uses a silhouette there and on the PIN screen. The profile picker uses an initial instead. Profiles receive their own server grants, library access, Continue Watching, artwork cache, and playback choices.

A successful switch keeps the current server when the profile can access it. Otherwise, the server picker offers that profile’s available servers. Back from that picker returns to the profiles.

See the [profile and PIN previews](SCREENSHOTS.md#plex-home) for the shared MiSTer and desktop layouts.

The same profile flow works with discovered servers and configured URLs. Configure Home members, library permissions, avatars, and PINs in Plex. MiSTerVision selects existing profiles and does not edit their settings. See [Plex’s PIN and switching behavior](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204232453-fast-user-switching/).

## Run locally

For discovery, use the [Ghostty discovery instructions](../tools/ghostty/README.md#plex-discovery). To choose a fixed server address instead, add a `server` section to your development `settings.json`. Preserve any other sections:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "provider": "plex",
    "url": "http://your-plex-server:32400"
  }
}
```

From the repository root, run:

```sh
python3 tools/ghostty/ghostty_harness.py --browse --ntsc --inline-video \
  --settings /path/to/settings.json \
  --state-dir /path/to/development-state
```

On first use, open `https://plex.tv/link` in a browser signed in to the account that can access your server. Enter the displayed code. Internet access is required for account linking. Later launches reuse the saved sign-in. Plex Home connections also recheck membership through plex.tv, and protected viewers must enter their PIN again.

The server URL can use HTTP or HTTPS and a reverse-proxy base path. TLS certificates are verified unless `server.insecure_tls` is true. That override never applies to Plex account linking. Credentials, queries, and fragments are not allowed in the URL. Do not put a Plex token in settings. Restart after changing the server section.

Plex saves the linking account, selected profile, and media-server grant together in `plex/server.json` beneath the state directory. The older `plex/session.json` sign-in is read during migration. Jellyfin uses `session.json` for its active user and `jellyfin-users.json` for saved Quick Connect users. Artwork and playback choices use separate provider identities, even if item IDs overlap. Switching to Jellyfin uses the same fields with `provider: "jellyfin"` and its URL. Removing `server` permits legacy `jellyfin.conf` fallback. Unknown providers stop startup instead of silently selecting another server.

## Playback and limits

The adapter requests progressive H.264 video with MP3 audio in Matroska, bounded by `server.transcode` (default 720×576 at 12 Mbps) and 30 fps for NTSC or 25 fps for PAL. Go opens the authenticated stream and passes bytes to the selected decoder. Resume and progress use Plex milliseconds translated to the shared timebase. Each prepared stream owns its timeline reporter and transcode cleanup.

Video preparation registers a Plex playback decision before opening the stream. The decision, stream, timeline reports, and cleanup use the same playback identity. A seek creates a new identity so the old stop report cannot terminate its replacement.

Subtitle tracks appear in the video options opened with Select/Tab. Plex burns image and embedded subtitle tracks into the video. Changing those tracks replaces the stream at the current position. Sidecar text subtitles download as UTF-8 SubRip and use the shared overlay without replacing playback. The adapter marks tracks that require burn-in through `MediaStream.RequiresBurnIn`. Jellyfin selects client rendering or server burn-in by subtitle codec.

Music uses artist → album → track navigation, ordered album queues, and whole-library shuffle. Original audio files pass through the authenticated loopback proxy with byte-range support. Shared controls handle pause, track changes, and music visuals. Album queues are bounded to 10,000 rows. Shuffle requests return up to 64 tracks per batch.

Testing on Ghostty and MiSTer covered sign-in, library navigation, Continue Watching, artwork, music and track navigation, photos, video seeking, subtitles, and Live TV. These checks do not establish compatibility with every source format or server setup. The shared transcode limits apply to both providers. Jellyfin's MPEG-2 codec selection does not apply to Plex.

Multi-file videos, relay connections, and Plex remote control are not implemented. The active viewing profile determines library access.

## Photos

Photo libraries use their Plex names in the carousel. Open an album or folder, then select a photo to open the shared viewer. Previous/next skips folders and videos. Up toggles the controls, and Back returns to the containing list. Automatic slideshow playback is not implemented. Video clips within photo libraries use normal video playback.

Plex resizes original photos to the viewer dimensions, preserves aspect ratio, and applies EXIF orientation. The client bounds image downloads and decoding. Missing or invalid images show a retry message. Photos use the shared memory cache. Album artwork and carousel mosaics use the shared disk caches.

## Live TV

A Live TV carousel card appears when the linked account can access enabled channels on a Plex DVR. Select the card to open the channel list. Selecting a channel starts playback immediately. Back stops playback and returns to that list. Original/Zoom, buffering feedback, controls, and decoded closed captions use the same UX as Jellyfin. Seeking and timeshift are not supported.

When a tuned channel exposes selectable audio alternatives, Select/Tab → Audio lists them with Plex’s labels. Changing audio briefly reloads at the live edge while keeping picture mode and the captions setting. Plex resolves each choice against the new session’s stream IDs before conversion. The choice applies to the current playback and is not saved in the client. Plex may remember the per-user selection.

Channels come from enabled DVR mappings, with duplicate tuner mappings removed and channel numbers sorted naturally. Protected channels are omitted when the tuner identifies them. Guide names and logos are optional. Current and next programs load in the background through the [shared channel-list guide](GO_BROWSING.md#live-tv-listings). Without a guide, the list uses tuner names or channel numbers. A full schedule grid, recording controls, and Plex's free online Live TV service are not included.

Tuning uses the shared `media.LiveTV` interface. Tuner startup has a 30-second deadline. Ordinary metadata requests have a 15-second timeout. Diagnostics identify tune requests without logging private channel or consumer IDs.

Each attempt owns a unique Plex consumer and conversion session. Stopping, canceling, or failing playback releases both without canceling another client's consumer or a DVR recording. Conversion uses the configured dimensions and bitrate, capped at 30 fps for 240p, 30000/1001 fps for 480i, or 25 fps for PAL, matching the shared output cadence policy.

Live TV from an HDHomeRun has been tested through Plex on Ghostty and MiSTer, including captions and alternate audio. Automated tests cover missing guide data, paging, source geometry, isolated ownership, cancellation, and failed preparation.

## Other library types

| Type | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Movies and TV shows | Supported, including recorded TV stored in ordinary libraries. |
| Music | Supported, including album queues and shuffle. |
| Other Videos | Uses Plex's movie/clip types and the shared video path. |
| Photos | Supported, including album folders and previous/next navigation. |
| Collections and playlists | Carousel cards, collection hierarchy, and ordered playlist browsing and playback. See [browsing behavior](GO_BROWSING.md#collections-and-playlists). |

Collections use `/library/all?type=18` and `/library/collections/{id}/items`. Playlists use `/playlists` and `/playlists/{id}/items`. Music, video, and photo playlists are supported, including normal and smart playlists. Playlist contents keep the server order and duplicate entries. Local playback stays paged, so large playlists do not inherit the 10,000-item remote queue limit. Edit playlists and collections in Plex.

## Code boundaries

[Application assembly](../cmd/mistervision/server.go) selects a [`connection.Connector`](../internal/connection/connector.go). [`plex.Connector`](../internal/plex/connector.go) links the account and returns a [`media.Server`](../internal/media/server.go) implemented by `plex.Client`. Plex endpoints, response types, and transcode policy stay in [`internal/plex`](../internal/plex). Neither the browser nor the renderer imports the adapter.

[`serverDiscovery`](../internal/plex/discovery.go) implements the shared `connection.Discoverer` interface. It retains server grants privately while the shared picker receives only names, identities, and addresses. [`gdmDiscovery`](../internal/plex/gdm.go) implements the same discovery interface for LAN addresses. Its anonymous UDP scan runs alongside the account request and stops on cancellation.

[`discovered_connection.go`](../internal/plex/discovered_connection.go) coordinates account linking, selection, and saved reconnection. [`home.go`](../internal/plex/home.go) handles Home membership, profile tokens, and PIN verification behind the shared `connection.ProfilePrompt` and `connection.ProfileSelection` contracts. [`home_avatars.go`](../internal/plex/home_avatars.go) implements `connection.ProfileAvatars` for public Plex artwork. The browser loads that artwork independently of authentication and cancels outstanding image requests when switching or closing a connection. [`recovery.go`](../internal/plex/recovery.go) constrains rediscovery to the remembered identity and asks before committing its new address.

[`serverstate`](../internal/serverstate/session.go) supplies private, atomic session storage to both adapters. The shared catalog and playback contracts cover video and music. `media.Artwork.Photo` supplies images to the shared photo viewer. The optional `media.LiveTV` contract covers tuner negotiation. [`live_channels.go`](../internal/plex/live_channels.go) discovers channels, [`live.go`](../internal/plex/live.go) owns tuner consumers, and [`transcode.go`](../internal/plex/transcode.go) shares conversion policy with recorded video. Provider-specific additions stay in the adapter.
