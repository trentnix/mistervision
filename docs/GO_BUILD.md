# Build and install

Use Go 1.26.8 or later, a C compiler, and Python 3 on Linux. Go module dependencies are pinned in [go.mod](../go.mod). MiSTer builds also need an ARM cross-compiler. Docker builds the separate MPlayer executable on the development machine, not on MiSTer.

## Go client

```sh
make host
make arm
# If Zig is outside PATH:
ZIG=/absolute/path/to/zig make arm
```

The outputs are `build/mistervision` and `build/mistervision-arm`. The ARM target enables cgo and uses `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7`. The [compiler wrapper](../tools/zig-cc-go.sh) targets `arm-linux-gnueabihf.2.31` and Cortex-A9. Zig 0.14.1 has been tested. `GO_ARM_CC` can select another compatible compiler. Set `GOCACHE` and `ZIG_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR` if their default directories are unwritable.

Development builds show `dev`, the Git revision, and a modified marker when available. Jellyfin and Plex requests report the same version label, without the revision suffix. Set `VERSION` for a stable release label:

```sh
make arm VERSION=v1.4.1
```

## MPlayer

Build the matching patched player from [Dockerfile.mistervision](../docker/Dockerfile.mistervision):

```sh
make native-player
```

The outputs are `build/mistervision-mplayer-arm` and its source/compiler record, `build/mistervision-mplayer-build.txt`. The base image is pinned by digest, and the build verifies the MPlayer source archive with SHA-256. The Bullseye toolchain targets MiSTer's glibc 2.31. The patches provide shared overlays, picture changes, captions, interlaced presentation, and playback timing fixes.

The original C client's player cannot substitute for this build. Update both binaries together when their protocol changes. See [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY.md) for corresponding source and licenses.

The native build also exports `build/mistervision-mplayer-source.tar.xz`, the verified upstream source used by that build. The source archive includes MPlayer's bundled FFmpeg. The Go vulnerability scan does not audit these native dependencies.

## Release bundles

From a clean Git checkout, build a release with:

```sh
make release VERSION=v1.4.1
```

This command rebuilds both ARM executables, records their metadata and checksums, and packages them under `build/releases/v1.4.1/`. It requires the same Go, Zig, Python, and Docker tools as the individual builds. Stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions are required. Dirty checkouts, untracked source files, invalid binaries, source checksum mismatches, and existing output directories stop the build. Failed builds do not publish a partial bundle.

| Artifact | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `mistervision-v1.4.1-progressive.zip` | Both binaries, interlaced core, launcher with a progressive first-install preset, examples, notices, metadata, and checksums. Also used for automatic updates. |
| `mistervision-v1.4.1-interlaced.zip` | The same files with an interlaced first-install preset in the launcher. |
| `mistervision-v1.4.1-source.tar.gz` | Committed project source plus the exact upstream MPlayer and interlaced Menu source archives. Patches and build recipes remain under `docker/`. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Checksums for both downloadable archives. |

The ZIP contains only example configuration files. It contains no active `jellyfin.conf`, `settings.json`, sign-in, preferences, or caches. Read its `INSTALL.txt` before copying files. Both ZIPs include the pinned interlaced core. The first-launch preset creates `settings.json` only if no current or legacy configuration exists. Neither reinstalling nor updating replaces active settings. `tools/interlaced-core.json` pins the upstream core and complete source archive. Release builds download missing components, verify their hashes, and fail on corrupt cached files.

To rebuild MPlayer from the source bundle, run `make native-player` in its extracted project directory. Docker uses the included upstream archive and still verifies its checksum. The base image and compiler packages need network access or a local Docker cache.

`make release-manifest` can run after separate `make arm` and `make native-player` builds. It writes `build/release-manifest.txt`, which records Go metadata, MPlayer source/compiler details, and both executable checksums. Packaging includes that record as `mistervision/BUILD.txt`, with the release version and source revision. Packaging the same inputs produces identical archives. This does not promise identical compiler output across toolchain or environment changes.

The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs when a version tag is pushed. It can also run manually with that tag selected as the workflow ref. It builds the bundle and creates a GitHub draft release with generated notes and all four assets. It refuses to overwrite an existing release. After creating the draft, it downloads the four assets, verifies their contents and source revision, and exercises installation and interrupted-update recovery in temporary storage. A verification failure leaves the release unpublished as a draft.

Before publishing, review the notes, require successful Go validation and downloaded-asset verification, and test the paired binaries on MiSTer. Publishing requires a manual action on GitHub. Draft or private releases are unavailable to the application's unauthenticated checker.

The [latest release](https://github.com/trentnix/mistervision/releases/latest) provides both archives and their checksums. Bundles include `mistervision/UPDATE_FORMAT` with transaction format `1`. The updater rejects older or incompatible formats before replacing any files.

## Install on MiSTer

Copy these files to the SD card and make them executable:

| File | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| `build/mistervision-arm` | `/media/fat/mistervision/mistervision` |
| `build/mistervision-mplayer-arm` | `/media/fat/mistervision/mplayer-arm` |
| [`tools/mistervision.sh`](../tools/mistervision.sh) | `/media/fat/Scripts/MiSTerVision.sh` |

Jellyfin discovery and Plex account-based server selection need no connection file. Choose Plex under About → Connections. For an explicit Jellyfin or Plex address, copy `settings.example.json` to `settings.json` beside the binaries and set `server.provider` and `server.url`. See [configuration and migration](GO_CONFIGURATION.md) for existing installations. Launch **MiSTerVision** from Scripts so Main_MiSTer enables framebuffer output. Launcher filenames must contain no spaces. A direct progressive-mode launch over SSH does not enable framebuffer output through Scripts.

The launcher enables both CPU cores, hides the console cursor, and reloads the normal menu after a successful exit. Failures leave their messages visible. Login and playback choices persist under `/media/fat/mistervision/state`. Caches use separate [artwork directories](GO_BROWSING.md#persistent-artwork-cache). For 480i, follow the [display guide](GO_DISPLAY.md).

For manual installation, exit before replacing binaries. Copy replacements to temporary filenames in the installation directory, set executable permissions, then rename them over the installed files. Always replace the client and matching player together.

## Moving from MiSTerFin CRT

The rename changes binaries, install directories, launcher names, release assets, and environment variables. Install the new application and its matching MPlayer together. MiSTerFin CRT v1.0.x cannot install the renamed bundle through About. MiSTerVision releases support subsequent updates from About.

On MiSTer, exit the old app and back up `/media/fat/misterfin-crt`. Copy its `settings.json`, optional `jellyfin.conf`, `state`, `covercache`, `gridcache`, `InterlacedMenu.rbf`, and custom assets into `/media/fat/mistervision`. Copy only files that exist. Update absolute paths in settings, including custom backgrounds and music assets.

Then install the new binaries and `Scripts/MiSTerVision.sh`. After testing, remove `Scripts/MiSTerFin-CRT.sh` so the menu has one entry. Keep the backup until the new installation is verified.

On desktop, move or copy `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/misterfin-crt` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mistervision`, using `~/.config` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset. Preserve both providers’ sessions and playback preferences. The same directory rename applies beneath the user cache root. Do not overwrite an existing destination without reconciling its contents. Explicit `--state-dir` paths remain supported, so development commands can continue using an old directory intentionally.

Environment overrides now start with `MISTERVISION_`, for example `MISTERVISION_SETTINGS` and `MISTERVISION_CACHE_ROOT`. The internal player and launcher protocol changed with the name, so an old player must not be paired with the renamed client. The new interlaced section is `[MiSTerVisionInterlaced]`. The old managed section can remain inert until removed after verification.

[Settings migration](GO_CONFIGURATION.md#migration) still combines legacy JSON configuration files. It does not move installation directories.

## Application updates

### Downloader-managed installations

The [MultiDatabases MiSTerVision database](https://github.com/theypsilon/MultiDatabases_MiSTer/tree/main/mister-vision) installs the published progressive package and preserves active configuration and state. The [README](../README.md#install-through-update_all-or-downloader) describes registration and installation. Exit MiSTerVision before running an external updater.

Native startup recognizes the `[MultiDatabases/mister-vision]` database registration in `/media/fat/downloader.ini`, then visible `.ini` files in `/media/fat/downloader/`, then `/media/fat/downloader_*.ini`. Each group is alphabetical, and the first matching section wins. The registration must include a nonempty `db_url`. Filenames alone do not establish ownership. These rules follow [Downloader’s documented locations and precedence](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Downloader_MiSTer/blob/main/docs/drop-in-databases.md).

For registered installations, About keeps release checks and notes but shows external-update instructions instead of Install. The browser also rejects installation requests. The native registration reader stays outside the shared browser and renderer. They receive only instructions and an optional installer. Startup rollback still runs before this policy is applied, so adopting Downloader cannot strand a pending built-in update.

Registration indicates update ownership, not that a previous download succeeded. Custom Downloader configuration paths, environment-only registrations, destination overrides, and download filters are not interpreted. Read failures or excessive configuration sizes suppress built-in installation with an explanation and a diagnostic event. Remove the registration and restart to restore the built-in updater. The app never edits Downloader configuration.

This detection is available starting with v1.4.2. v1.4.1 supports database installation but still offers its built-in installer, which users of the database must avoid.

### Built-in and manual updates

MiSTerVision v1.4.0 and earlier require a one-time manual installation of v1.4.1 or later. These clients still show the available release and its notes, but the renamed ZIPs suppress the incompatible Install action. Their existing status line says “No installation bundle is available.” The release summary must explain the manual upgrade and point to the release page. Keep publishing the new archive names in later releases so older clients cannot offer an incompatible download.

In About, select **View release**, review the notes, then select **Install**. Automatic installation requires the client at `/media/fat/mistervision/mistervision` and the configured player at `/media/fat/mistervision/mplayer-arm`. The standard Scripts launcher is updated with the pair. Custom installations and desktop development retain manual installation.

For manual upgrades, use the latest release ZIP. Keep the existing settings and state files. Do not copy example configuration over active configuration.

Downloads use verified HTTPS from this repository's GitHub release assets without credentials. The installer verifies the outer SHA-256 checksum, every bundled file, the release version, transaction format, and ARM executable headers. File counts and sizes are bounded. Checksums detect damaged downloads. They are not signatures independent of GitHub.

The SD card must have room for the download, staged files, rollback copies, and a temporary replacement file. The installer downloads, validates, and backs up everything before changing installed files. Storage or validation failures leave the installation intact. Settings, credentials, preferences, and artwork caches are excluded from replacement. The bundled core participates in the same verified installation and rollback as the binaries. The progressive update launcher cannot change a saved interlaced setting.

Update failures distinguish download, verification, and storage problems and explain what to try next. If a release requires manual installation, Install is disabled for that release and the page directs you to its ZIP. Cancellation and recoverable failures confirm that the existing installation was kept.

A successful update shows “Update installed. Restarting...” for two seconds, closes the client, and starts the installed launcher again. In 480i, the supervisor restores the normal core before restart. Cleanup or startup failures stop with an error instead of retrying. Cancellation or a replacement failure restores the old files. Custom launchers without restart support require reopening the app after an update.

If interrupted, startup uses `.update-pending` to finish rollback, then re-executes the restored client before opening the display. A committed transaction only needs backup cleanup. Do not delete pending recovery files. If recovery cannot finish, the app stops before playback. Correct the storage problem and relaunch, or manually reinstall the matching pair while preserving settings and state.

## Local development

```sh
python3 tools/ghostty/ghostty_harness.py --demo --ntsc
```

The demo builds the client and serves mock browsing data. It does not provide playable media. See the [harness guide](../tools/ghostty/README.md) for dependencies and real-server playback.

For a framebuffer test without a media server:

```sh
make headless
python3 tools/ghostty/ghostty_harness.py --go --ntsc
```

`make headless` writes `build/go-frame.raw` and `build/go-frame.png` at 640×288. The Ghostty command shows the color bars at 640×240 until interrupted. Direct test-frame runs accept `-headless WIDTHxHEIGHT`, `-output PATH`, and either `-hold 10s` or `-wait`. Hardware test frames need a hold or wait option to remain visible.

For physical framebuffer previews and reproduction of MiSTer playback-size errors, see the [harness framebuffer guide](../tools/ghostty/README.md#framebuffer-previews-and-native-playback-checks). The local matrix covers 480-line, 720p, and 1080p output without changing hardware configuration.

## Tests and CI

Install a C compiler, Python 3, FFmpeg, libmpv, and the libavcodec/libavutil development headers. Then run:

```sh
make host
make lint
make vulnerability-check
make test
go test -race ./...
make test-browse
```

`make lint` checks formatting, runs `go vet`, and uses pinned Staticcheck. [Linter settings](../staticcheck.conf) preserve proper-name capitalization in errors. `make vulnerability-check` uses pinned govulncheck to check reachable Go advisories. It does not scan native MPlayer dependencies.

`make test` covers Go with and without cgo plus Python/native adapter tests. `make test-browse` runs the built client against isolated HTTP/WebSocket fixtures. Generated media and local servers avoid a real media-server account or MiSTer dependency. Decoder tests can skip when their external dependencies are absent.

| CI job | Checks and triggers | Timeout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Host validation](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | Commands above, on pushes, pull requests, and manual runs. | 15 minutes |
| Endurance smoke and performance reports | Two real-decoder recovery cycles and existing Go benchmarks run in host validation. Reports upload even when later checks fail. | Within the host limit |
| [Extended reliability](../.github/workflows/reliability.yml) | A 15-minute run each night. Manual runs select 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes. | 80 minutes |
| [ARM compilation](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | `make arm` with checksum-verified Zig 0.14.1, on the same triggers. | 10 minutes |
| [Native player](../.github/workflows/native-player.yml) | Complete patched MPlayer build and ARM verification when build inputs change, on `v*` tags, or on manual request. | 30 minutes |

The validation workflows use Ubuntu 24.04, read-only repository permissions, and Node.js 24 action runtimes. Node.js is not an application dependency. The separate release workflow has a 40-minute limit and repository write permission to create draft releases. No workflow deploys to MiSTer or makes the repository public.

CI does not establish physical CRT timing. Hardware checks must cover startup/exit, video and music, repeated overlay toggling, seeking, paused picture changes, and A/V synchronization in each supported output mode. See [tested scope](GO_DISPLAY.md#tested-scope).

## Endurance and recovery

Build dependencies are the same as the browser tests. The short check runs two cycles:

```sh
make test-endurance
```

For a longer run, keep one browser process alive for at least 15 minutes:

```sh
make host
python3 -m tools.ghostty.endurance --seconds 900
```

Each cycle uses generated video, the production desktop decoder with null audio, and an isolated Jellyfin fixture. It changes movies, verifies moving frames, pauses, shows and hides controls, resumes, seeks, stops, rejects a stream with HTTP 503, retries after restoration, cancels a blocked stream request, and plays again. It checks decoder cleanup and normal application exit. Every wait has a deadline. Missing Linux process data, FFmpeg, libmpv, or the host binary fails the command instead of silently skipping it.

`build/reports/endurance.json` records the tested binary checksum, startup and initial list-navigation time, playback-ready/seek/recovery timings, browser memory, file descriptors, threads, and child counts. Resource changes are reported without arbitrary performance thresholds. `endurance.events.json` retains the bounded diagnostic history from the fixture. Use `--report PATH` for a separate run. Failure reports can contain no completed samples if startup fails.

The harness finishes the current cycle after the duration expires. Scheduled runs upload reports for 30 days. PR runs upload reports for 14 days. Tests use no saved accounts and do not open workstation audio or a physical display. The fixture serves the same generated clip for each requested seek offset, so these runs test replacement/recovery and resumed frame delivery, not content-accurate seeking or CRT cadence. They do not cover Plex server behavior, a real tuner, midstream network restoration, or long uninterrupted A/V synchronization. Existing provider and decoder tests cover separate cases.

## Performance reports

Run the existing rendering, caption, artwork-cache, music-visualization, UI, and output-publication benchmarks:

```sh
make performance
```

Reports contain raw Go benchmark output, individual samples, medians, the revision and dirty-checkout flag, and hardware/toolchain metadata in `build/reports/performance/`. PR and scheduled workflows attach the reports and show the Markdown table in their job summaries. Timing changes are informational. Benchmark failures still fail the command.

To compare against a downloaded report from a previous run:

```sh
python3 tools/performance_report.py --baseline /tmp/previous-report.json
```

The comparison omits timing deltas if the recorded environment differs. Matching metadata does not eliminate shared-runner noise. Compare repeated measurements before treating a difference as a regression. These benchmarks do not measure physical scanout or A/V drift.

## Verify a release

With Go and an authenticated GitHub CLI, download and verify a draft or published release:

```sh
make verify-release VERSION=v1.4.1
```

The local Git checkout must contain the release tag. Verification checks all three archive hashes, every bundled checksum, executable permissions and ARM headers, version and revision metadata, the source archive against that Git revision, and the pinned player and interlaced-core source checksums. It then installs the real ZIP through the production updater into temporary storage and tests interrupted replacement and repeat recovery while preserving fixture settings and sign-in files. The test never executes the installed ARM binaries on the host. Checksums are integrity checks, not independent signatures.

To verify existing downloads and optionally execute the packaged pair on a MiSTer:

```sh
python3 tools/verify_release.py v1.4.1 \
  --directory /tmp/mistervision-v1.4.1-release \
  --mister root@192.168.1.42 \
  --identity /home/trent/.ssh/misterfin_crt_development
```

Omit `--identity` to use normal SSH configuration. Hardware checks require noninteractive SSH access, FFmpeg on the host, and free space in MiSTer's `/tmp`. The command creates a unique temporary directory, renders a headless test frame, decodes generated video with null audio/video outputs, and removes its files. It does not deploy, edit settings, switch the core, or validate the CRT picture. Existing hardware installation and visual checks remain separate. Hardware execution is never triggered by hosted CI.
